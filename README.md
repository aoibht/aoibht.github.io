Code used to host the website ResumeJoe.com

I created this website when I was first learning front-end development for a project at work. Since then I have continued to use it as a sandbox to learn programming and UI design.

I think it is kind of cool because I can track my professional, and technical, development. 

Right now the homepage of the website is designed to appear as a resume. kind of like in microsoft word. There is a grid at the top containing various categories. These categories all contain a hyperlinks to more traditional looking web pages, describing my experience with that.

Github pages (I believe) only allows statically coded websites - which is not true haha.

I have been in the world of web development for a few months now. Taking this webpage which is purely html and css and converting it to use vue-js. Again, this is a learning opportunity for a project at work.
