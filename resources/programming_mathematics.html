                    This still needs to me made into a cohesive idea <br>
                    I graduated Beloit College majoring in economics and minoring in physics. I have been interested in financial
                    markets since I was a kid. As a middle schooler, I had an Etrade account where I threw around a whole hundred 
                     bucks. That's where I learned the harsh realities of service fees. In high school I was the president of my 
                    school's stock club, planning weekly meetings and organizing annual trips to visit the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago
                    This all meant that coming into college I knew I wanted to study markets. I just had no clue where to begin.

                <p class = "general-paragraph">
                    I started a few months after Andrej Karpathy's  <a href = "http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural
                    Networks</a> was published. At the time, I didn't understand matrix algebra, let alone complicated loss functions. That
                    didn't stop this article, and the papers that followed it, from dominating many of my academic discussions at the time.
                    This made me interested in how these methods would be applied to finance. I shared my curiousity with some of my  
                    teachers - Dr. Munro, professor of data analytics; Dr. Moulton, professor of econometrics - who encouraged 
                    me to take programming more seriously. It was under Dr. Moulton where I was awarded a research grant to study 
                    financial forecasting through the Sanger Research Program.

                <p class = "general-paragraph">
                    During the Sanger Research, programming changed from being a tool I used, to one of my main hobbies. I spent 
                    my senior year formalizing my understanding of concepts related to programming and computer science.
                    that is a short explanation for how I went from economics to software engineering.
