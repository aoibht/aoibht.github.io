                    I graduated Beloit College majoring in economics and minoring in physics. I have been interested in financial<br>
                    markets since I was a kid. As a middle schooler, I had an Etrade account where I threw around a whole hundred <br>
                     bucks. That's where I learned the harsh realities of service fees. In high school I was the president of my <br>
                    school's stock club, planning weekly meetings and organizing annual trips to visit the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago<br>
                    This all meant that coming into college I knew I wanted to study markets. I just had no clue where to start  <br>

                    I started school a few months after Andrej Karpathy's  <a href = "http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural <br>
                    Networks</a> was published. At the time, I didn't understand matrix algebra, let alone complicated loss functions. That <br>
                    didn't stop this article, and the papers that followed it, from dominating many of my academic discussions at the time.<br> 
                    This made me interested in how these methods would be applied to finance. I shared my curiousity with some of my  <br>
                    teachers - Dr. Munro, professor of data analytics; Dr. Moulton, professor of econometrics - who encouraged <br>
                    me to take programming more seriously. It was under Dr. Moulton where I was awarded a research grant to study <br>
                    financial forecasting through the Sanger Research Program.

                    During the Sanger Research, programming changed from being a tool I used, to one of my main hobbies. I spent <br>
                    my senior year formalizing my understanding of concepts related to programming and computer science <br>
                    and that is a short explanation for how I went from economics to software engineering.
