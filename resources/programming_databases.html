                    I interact with relational databases eveyday in my current position. I use both embedded and dynamic SQL to perform 
                    queries primarily for data transformations and web development. I do not have experience with Schema design or writing advanced queries. 
                    I received certification in SQL from  InterSystems in Cambridge, MA.

                    I have become increasingly familar with document databases, specifically MongoDB, since starting to work on  
                    web applications. MongoDB is a database that "<a href= "https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb">Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents<a>".
                    MongoDB is really easy to work especially when doing development using JS-Adjacent Languages. MongoDB is open source 
                    and has a good amount of documentation surrounding it which makes it an a great choice for independent project.

                    I work with object databases extensively in my current position. Cache, an object database from Intersystems,
                    is the database that my company uses as its primary back-end. Object Databases allow you to create and transform
                    objects more easily because they it treats data as object.
