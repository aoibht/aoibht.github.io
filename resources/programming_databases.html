                    I interact with relational databases eveyday in my current position. :ike everyone else, I use SQL to query these  <br>
                    tables. I use both embedded and dynamic SQL queries for data transformations and web development. While I use SQL<br>
                    often, I do not have experience with Schema design or writing advanced queries. I received certification in SQL from  <br>
                    InterSystems in Cambridge, MA.

                    I have become increasingly familar with document databases, specifically MongoDB, since starting to work on  <br>
                    web applications. MongoDB is a database that "<a href= "https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb">Stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents<a>". Is really easy to work <br>
                    especially when doing development using a framework within the JavaScript family. MongoDB is open source <br>
                    and has a good amount of documentation surrounding it making it ideal (to me) for small, independent projects.
