                        Data Collection is one of my favorite parts of analytics. Recently, I used BeautifulSoup4 to scrape the FHIR 
                        medical standards. Web-Scraping is my most common way of collecting data, but I also experience collecting data 
                        in  more formal settings.
                        <br>
                        When collecting data, I almost always use Python. Python has two libraries, BeaitufilSoup and Selenium, which make
                        scraping website incredibly easy. Those third-party libraries, along with built libraries like http and sqlite, make
                        Python my continued go to for data collection
                        <br>
                        I usually store collected data into a SQLite database. If the data I am scraping is small enough, I will also store
                        it to a CSV file.

                        My main experiences with data pre-processing have to do with financial and healthcare data. With financial data 
                        I have used data normalizations when analyzing financial data to account for weighted differences in price changes.
                        I have experience normalizing healthcare data from hl7 v2.x to v3 (CDA) and v4 (FHIR).

                        Data Cleaning is the necessary evil of data analytics. When I first started in data analytics, I collected 
                        data by automating a financial API called IEX Finance. The data I was collecting was on a minute interval, and 
                        because it was free, this meant that there were many holes of missing data throughout the time series.
