            Most of my skills with data science come from being a broke college student. Data on financial instruments can  
            sell for <a href = http://www.kibot.com/buy.aspx> hundreds of dollars</a> online. As an undergraduate researcher, my school gave me a budget of ~$600. which 
            was spent almost entirely on books and server time. I needed a way to get the data myself.

            At the time, IEX ofference a free API which would give you a days worth of minute-interval for any ticker you asked <
            for. The major downside of this was that you could only pull data on one company, from one day, with each request
            Fortunately they did not have an rate limits. I wrote a program which read a list of N ticker symbols and 
            pulled data for each day available. Once I got this data into csv form I then had to clean it.

            Companies who have provided free data APIs in the past (Morninstar, IEX, Google, Yahoo), 
            have all transitioned from to a paid service (IEX and Morningstar,), or no longer offering the service in any useful way 
            (Yahoo and Google).
