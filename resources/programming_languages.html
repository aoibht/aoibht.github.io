                        Rust is the primary language behind my current project. This is a 
                        medical messaging parser that converts HL7 messages into SQL. This project uses SQLite as a backend, 
                        where it is used to label extracted data, and then store that labeled data.

                        One of the primary ways of sending medical data is a CCD. This is a XML

                        different schemas for their CCDs. XSLT is great for normalizing this data.
