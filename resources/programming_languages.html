                    Python is my favorite language for doing things fast. Python's ecosystems combined with its abstractions <br>
                    allow me to go from idea to implementation without a lot of hassle. That makes the language really fun to me.<br>
                    Most of my Python development has been focused on data collection (BeautifulSoup, HTTP), data cleaning (Pandas, <br>
                    Numpy), data analysis (TensorFlow, Keras, sci-kit) and data visualization (MatplotLib). These are some of my  <br>
                    favorite modules and my i really enjoy working with them. Right now I am using them to explore the data structures <br>
                    of medical standards.

                    I learned JavaScript for various projects at work. My experience with JavaScript stems entirely from its ubiquity<br>

                    been exposed to many of the major themes within the JS ecosystem.

                    Rust is the language that I am most interested at this time. Reading <a href = "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Book </a> exposed me to many <br>

                    the general field of computer architecture. I choose X86 simply because my machine is running on an i5. I also recently <br>
