                        Angular is the JavaScript framework I am most familiar with. In my current position,
                        I am the primary developer for a direct-to-consumer website, which allows users to manage and view their personal healthcare information.
                        This application, called InterSystem's Personal Community, was written using AngularJS. While I don't 
                        mind AngularJS, I prefer Angular and its use of TypeScript more.

                        I work with JSON a lot in my current position. Many of the most exciting healthcare technologies are built on 
                        top of a data type called FHIR. FHIR is a JSON representation of personal health information. This could be anything
                        from a condition you were diagnosed with, to the amount you paid to be diagnosed with it.
                        In my current position, I create what are called SMART on FHIR applications. These applications are notable in their use 
                        of the FHIR standard to transport data. Additionally, my personal research is focused on FHIR.

                        JQuery is the library my team uses at work for practically every application. My main use for JQuery is its functionality 
                        around REST, but I have quickly having to use it for a wider range of tasks.
